        <h1>🏛️ H2O (version 1)</h1>
        <p>
          This version of <a href="https://opencasebook.org/">the H2O platform</a> was live from 2012-2018, and was the second iteration of the project.
          In this phase, H2O began to organize around entire digital-first casebooks, and was primarily focused on creating “fluid and lightweight” alternatives to “static and heavy” commercial casebooks.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          All casebooks published with H2O were openly licensed and could be remixed and adapted by new authors. 
          The platform also made individual cases and other legal documents easily discoverable.
        </p>

        <p>
          A primary innovation was to give authors access to an annotation tool that allowed them to collapse segments of a legal document to make it more readable by students.
