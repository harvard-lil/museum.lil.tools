        <h1>🏛️ H2O Playlist Beta</h1>
        <p>The original version of <a href="https://opencasebook.org/">H2O</a> launched in the early 2000s as a simple tool authors could use to cluster lists of readings around a certain topic.</p>
        <p>This was before the advent of MOOCs and other openly available educational content, and leveraging technology to give members of the public the ability to follow readings and discussions among legal scholars was a primary focus of the project.</p>
        <p>All "playlists" were openly licensed and could be shared freely.</p>
